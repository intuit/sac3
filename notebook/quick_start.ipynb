       "[\"A: We can check if 3691 is a prime number by testing if it's divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root. \\n\\nThe square root of 3691 is approximately 60.77, so we only need to check if it's divisible by prime numbers less than or equal to 60. \\n\\nWe can quickly eliminate even numbers, since 3691 is odd. \\n\\nDivisibility by 3:\\n3 + 6 + 9 + 1 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 3691 is not divisible by 3. \\n\\nDivisibility by 5:\\n3691 does not end in 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5. \\n\\nDivisibility by 7:\\nTo check if 3691 is divisible by 7, we can take the last digit (1) and double it, then subtract that result from the remaining digits (369 - 2 = 367). We can continue this process until we get a number we know the divisibility of. \\n\\n36 - 2*1 = 34\\n3 - 2*4 = -5\\n\\nSince -5 is not divisible by 7, neither is 3691. \\n\\nWe can continue checking for divisibility by other prime numbers, but it's clear that 3691 is not divisible by any primes less than or equal to 60. Therefore, 3691 is a prime number.\",\n",
